## How to CODE in KOTLIN ?

  Two Steps:
  
    1. Install Java JDK (Java Development Kit)

       Since Kotlin is Interoperable with Java because Kotlin file at compile time is 
       converted to .class file (Byte Code) which contain a whole kotlin code converted 
       to Java code. As Kotlin and Java both runs on JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
       

    2. Install IntelliJ IDEA

       A JetBrains developed platform for Java or kotlin Users. To implement your Java
       or Kotlin codes as well as a better interface with optimised features for 
       projects including Open Source.
